## Using the Site

### Cookie Policy

By using this site, you consent to our use of cookies. You can manage your cookie preferences in your account settings after logging into Web-Breakout. Please note that Performance and Data cookies are mandatory for the proper functioning of the site. We use cookies for website performance, account verification and session management, project loading, and to remember your preferences in settings.

### Project Policy

All projects created on our platform must comply with the laws in place and our RULES document. Please refer to RULES.md and the "Projects and User Interaction" section for detailed guidelines on project content.

### Online Servers Policy

By default, projects run on the same WebServer that this website is running on. However, you may use WebSockets within the scope of the program. Please refrain from abusing the WebSocket in ways such as using hidden invalid ASCII (Unicode) characters, running applications that are not already packaged within the project, attempting to edit data on external websites, running any kind of embed or iframe, conducting payment transactions, or creating unfiltered chat areas other than the already created Comments section on your project. For more details, please see RULES.md.

## Projects and User Interaction

### Content Guidelines

#### Violent/Disturbing Content

We categorize violent content based on its suitability for different age groups:

- Under 8: cartoon violence, mild violence. (FE)
- Under 13: cartoon violence, mild violence, or fantasy violence. (FE)
- 13 and over: cartoon violence, mild violence, fantasy violence, gore. (FS and NFE)

Please note that strong gore and sexually oriented violence are not tolerated for any age group.

#### Suggestive/Explicit Content

We do not allow any suggestive or explicit content for users under 8. For guidelines applicable to users aged 13 and above, please refer to the "Content" section in RULES.md.

#### Profanity or Unallowed Words

While mild language is permissible, profanity is not. If your project includes a list of swear words for the purpose of user input detection, we recommend using our provided import instead of creating your own. Please note that some words that may be considered swear words are not marked as such. If you find an issue with our filter, feel free to contact us.

### Chat/Comments Section

New accounts cannot comment without a confirmed email. Users who are not signed in can view comments but cannot post them. After confirming your email, you will need to verify that you are not a bot. For more details, please see RULES.md.

## Project Reviews and Ratings

### Reviews by the MasterCode Team

We review your project in three ways:

1. **As a User**: We view your projects as any other user would. If we find your project to be of high quality and in compliance with these TERMS and the RULES, we may feature it on the /public page.

2. **Through the Editor**: Even if you have disabled 'let others view code', we retain the ability to view your code to check for viruses or anomalies. Please note that we can always see your editor and WebSockets. For more details, refer to RULES.md.

3. **Through our Reviewing API**: We can rate your project in six ways: For Everyone (FE), For Some (FS), Not For Everyone (NFA), Private (P), Unshared (NAN), and Removed (R). For detailed descriptions of these ratings, refer to RULES.md.

### Reviews by Other Users

Other users can view your projects and rate them. If you wish to make your code private to only you and your collaborators, you can disable 'let others view code'.

### Ratings by the MasterCodeProjectBuild Team

In addition to the Reviewing API, we can rate your project as a normal user would. However, if we believe that your project is receiving incorrect ratings, we reserve the right to disable ratings without your consent.

### Ratings by Other Users

Users can rate your projects using the provided button, not via chat.
