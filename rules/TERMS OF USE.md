-- Project Reviews and Ratings--

    a. Reviews by the MasterCodeProjectBuild team

        We review your project in 3 ways:
            1. As a user would.
                We can see your projects as viewed.
                We usually do this if we think your project is good.
                If your project is really good and follows these TERMS and the RULES,
                we may put it on the /public page.

            2. Through the editor
                Even if you have 'let others view code' set to off,
                we can still view your code to check for viruses or anomolies.
                DO NOT TRY TO HIDE STUFF FROM US. 
                We can always see your editor and WebSockets.
                See RULES.md for more details.

            3. Through our Reviewing Api
                We can rate your project in 6 ways:
                    FE => For Everyone
                    FS => For Some
                    NFA => Not For Everyone
                    P => Private
                    NAN => Unshared
                    R => Removed

                    For Everyone:
                        The project contains content that everyone of all ages can handle.
                        These can show up on the Public page, Search results, and Studios.
                        We WILL NOT put content for people under 5 years of age on the front page however.
                        We will have a badge on your project to tell you if we put it on the Public page.

                    For Some:
                        The project contains content that people over 13 years of age can handle.
                        These projects still can show up on the Public page, Search results, and Studios.
                        We will have a badge on your project to tell you if we put it on the Public page.

                    Not For Everyone:
                        Projects rated this rating means that this project contains stuff that violates to the specific required directs in the RULES,
                        but is not violating any of the other RULES.
                        These can't show up on the Public page, Search results, but can show up on Studios and are still visible.
                    
                    Private:    
                        Projects rated this are projects that the user set to private.
                        These projects still have to apply by the rules since they are still shared, but only to specific people.
                        These can't show up on the Public page, Search results, or Studios, but are still visible via URL.

                    Unshared:
                        These projects are projects that have not been shared by the user.
                        These can't show up anywhere except on this website.
                        These projects do not have to abide by most of the RULES but still cannot be of Porne or Viruses.

                    Removed:
                        These are projects that have been unshared or banned by the MasterCodeProjectBuild team.

                        Removed projects when reshared will be rated NFE.

        However, if we feel that your project is getting incorrect ratings, we can turn it off without your consent.

    d. Ratings by other users
        Users cannot rate your projects by chat, but by button.
        ---
        If you have been rated many hearts, your project will be more likely to show up on the public page.
        If you have been rated many favorites, your project will show up on the favoritor's profile.
