## Project Rules

The projects you share and post are visible to the entire community except for those under the age of eight. Your project can be used for many good things such as an entertaining game, 
a fun movie, or even just a document, however with good also comes bad as some content that can be used on those projects which does not comply with our RULES or the government laws.

We strive to make sure that users and projects are treated as fairly and respectfully as possible. Therefore, things that would be disrespectful to us and other users are not allowed.
Also things that go against our specific MasterCode RULES that are for the Team's eyes only are not allowed as well.

We do not promote homosexuality or bestality, nor do we allow the derogatory terms or memes that go with it. We do not celebrate halloween or pride month on this website. Therefore, projects made within those time periods may not be recommended to the front page as the only main holidays we celebrate are Spring Break, Summer Break, Christmas, and Back-To-School Day.

We do not allow profanity on our projects unless it is censored or cut off.
