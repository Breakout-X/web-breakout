During working hours, we only permit employees to use technology such as cellphones, social media or the internet for personal use while on break. When posting company-related content on social media, employees must express that they're posting on behalf of themselves and not the company. The opinions they express should be respectful of the company. If an employee has a comment or concern about the MasterCodeProject, it's best they bring it up to their manager or human resources rather than posting it online.

As MasterCodeProjectBuild, we value giving credit when credit is due. Employees shall only take credit for their own original work. When using other resources, employees must use proper citations to give credit.
